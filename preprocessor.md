## Preprocessor
### Generally, he preprocessor does 3 things, before the compilation of a program:
* removes comments.
* replace header files in a program, with its content.
*expands (substitutes) macros.

## There 3 uses for the preprocesssor:
* Directives.
* Constants.
* Macros.

# Directives:
## They always begin with a sharp sign #.
## Directives are commands to tell the preprocessor:
* to skip part of a file.
* include another file.
* define a constant or a macro.

## Macro
* Macros in C are string replacements commonly used to define constants.

## Include guard
* an #include guard, sometimes called a macro guard, header guard or file guard, is a particular construct used to avoid the problem of double inclusion when dealing with the include directive.
