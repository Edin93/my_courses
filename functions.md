# Function Pointers
* A function is just a set of instructions stored in one contiguous block of memory.
* A function is a set of instructions to perform a sub-task.
* A function call in machine language will basically be an instuction to jump to the entry point/address of some function(precisely to jump to first instruction in a function).
* A function pointer store the address of a function, in other words it stores the starting address/ entry point of that function of the block of memory containing all the instructions of that function.
# Function Pointers and Callbacks.
* A function pointer can be passed as arguments to functions.
* When reference to a function is passed to another function, then that particular function is called a callback function.
